# dotfiles

My dotfiles for nix using home-manager, currently used on NixOS with the nixos-unstable channel.

Different configurations for different machines are in their respective folder, [laptop](https://github.com/IvarWithoutBones/dotfiles/tree/master/laptop) and [pc](https://github.com/IvarWithoutBones/dotfiles/tree/master/pc). 
Files which do not differentiate between the two are in the [common folder](https://github.com/IvarWithoutBones/dotfiles/tree/master/common), and symlinked to both the machines folders.
